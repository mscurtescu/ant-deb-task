Welcome to the AutoFsck graphical configuration utility.  
From the menu you have just seen, you can configure:

1:  How often the disks on your system are checked.  This is a numeric value, for example 30; in this case, the disks on most systems will be checked after the computer has been booted 30 times.  Recommendations vary, but 35 is a common default, however if you find you boot a laptop several times a day, a higher value may help.  It is generally recommended to check older hard disk drives more regularly than new ones.  For more advice, try googling for information about fsck.

2:  Whether there is an audible prompt when the dialogue asking to check your disks appears.  This is very useful as it is possible that when shutting down your computer, you may quickly turn off the monitor before the AutoFsck dialogue appears, or without noticing it.  If the audio prompt is on, you'll hear a short musical scale (C Blues) to prompt you, but some users may wish to disable this if they need a quiet environment.

3:  Whether the checks are run on reboot (recommended) or shutdown.  The default time to run the checks is after a quick reboot (the system is rebooted, the checks are run, and then the system is then halted) but optionally, the checks can be run on shutdown (the checks are run and the system halted, no reboot is used).  Running the checks on reboot allows information about their progress to be displayed (this may not be possible if the checks are run on shutdown).  Some systems have problems running the shutdown method.  The shutdown method is provided for users who do not wish their system to restart, for example users who have BIOS passwords or have another Operating System as the default boot option.

From the menu you can also arrange disk checks now - note that this will simply set up the checks, they will be carried out when you shut down your computer.
