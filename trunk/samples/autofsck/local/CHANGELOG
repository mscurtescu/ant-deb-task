AutoFsck V2.5 - 20th September 2007 - GNU General Public License v3

Changelog:

----------2.5----------
AutoFsck V2.5 (released 20th September 2007) is another major rewrite, the entire
disk checking system (the script which calls fsck) has been rewritten.  

New Features:

 - An audible alert (provided by package 'beep') sounds when the user is prompted.
 - Filesystem checks are actually performed on shutdown, no longer requires restart.

As AutoFsck has changed so much, here's an outline of how it works:
When the user ends their session, AutoFsck is called by /etc/gdm/PostSession/Default.
AutoFsck uses tune2fs to find out if any filesystems are nearly due for checking.
If a check is required, the user is prompted.
If user declines, /fastboot is created and script terminated.
If user accepts, /etc/rc0.d/S89autofsck is created.
When the machines shuts down it executes S89autofsck just before S90halt.
S89autofsck remounts the filesystems read-only and runs fsck.
S89autofsck then remounts / read-write to remove itself.
Shutdown continues and completes.

----------2.0----------
AutoFsck V2.0 uses the same method as AutoFsck v1 for checking the disks, but the
method used to determine if a disk check is required, and the asking of the user
has been completely re-written.

The main advantages of the rewrite are:

 - AutoFsck now works regardless of the maximum mount count variable set on the partition.
 - The user is now queried on shutdown rather than login. 

This is the second version of AutoFsck, I believe it to be stable and production
ready, however if there are any bugs, please drop me an email.
AutoFsck was designed for Ubuntu, and has so far been tested on:
Ubuntu 6.06LTS - The Dapper Drake
Ubuntu 6.10 - The Edgy Eft
Ubuntu 7.04 - The Feisty Fawn
It should work on any Gnome based GNU/Linux system, please email me to let me
know what you have tried it on.
