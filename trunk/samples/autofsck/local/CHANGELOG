----------Release Notes V3.0----------
Added support for KDM as well as GDM, AutoFsck is called from:
/etc/gdm/PostSession/Default		GDM
/etc/kde3/kdm/Xreset			KDM
And the script is located:
/usr/bin/autofsck
A config file is found at:
/etc/autofsckrc
A .desktop file is also used for desktop integration to the GUI config tool.

Also written in some sub-scripts, accessible via the command line options:
--beep
--set
--sr
--config
--menu

--beep enables or dissables the audio prompt which is produced (via beep)
when the dialogue appears.  

--set allows the user to easily set the frequency of the checks (it changes
the 'max mount count' of all filesystems to a figure specified by the user).
--sr allows the user to enable or disable checking the filesystems on shutdown
rather than using the recommended method of rebooting the system.

--config loads the configuration script which gives access to --beep and --set
via a gui menu (provided by zenity).

--menu calls --config, but via gksu so that the password will be requested, and
the script will then be run as root.  This means the password will only be
required once.

NOTE that for autofsck to run normally (do it's usual checks when the user logs
out) it needs to be called with --check

----------Release Notes V2.5----------
AutoFsck V2.0 uses the same method as AutoFsck v1 for checking the disks, but the
method used to determine if a disk check is required, and the asking of the user
has been completely re-written.

The main advantages of the rewrite are:

 - AutoFsck now works regardless of the maximum mount count variable set on the partition.

 - The user is now queried on shutdown rather than login. 

This is the second version of AutoFsck, I believe it to be stable and production
ready, however if there are any bugs, please drop me an email.
AutoFsck was designed for Ubuntu, and has so far been tested on:
Ubuntu 6.06LTS - The Dapper Drake
Ubuntu 6.10 - The Edgy Eft
Ubuntu 7.04 - The Feisty Fawn
It should work on any Gnome based GNU/Linux system, please email me to let me
know what you have tried it on.
